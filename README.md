# Linux-Index
A Perl program I made to display, update, and search a document containing notes I've taken while learning Linux. Using a bash alias I can use this program anywhere directly from the command line.

Also includes a second program acting as a flashcard/study-guide game, randomly selecting descriptions of terms and prompting the user to enter the correct term.
